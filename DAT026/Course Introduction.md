We will get to know some of the plurality of mathematical and scientific models.

We will also get familiar with how to choose models for a specific problem

Complexity vs simplicity
------------------------

More complex models are not necessarily better.

Descriptive mathematics
-----------------------

1. Gather knowledge (data) about reality.
1. Find a model that to a certain extent can describe the data.
1. Draw conclusions from model

Going from data to a model is a creative and intuitive step. It's more like a
design process than deductive reasoning.

However, Drawing conclusions from a model is analytical – a computer could do
it. It is more deuctive reasoning.

A lot of mathematic eduction focuses on going between step 2 and 3, becuse that
is "simpler" to teach. This course will but more emphasis on going between step
1 and 2 than perphaps any other course in mathematics in a basic program.

Why modeling?
-------------

> A convenient way to represent realuty so that we more easily can draw
> conclustions about it.

Helps us understand, remember and reason.

**Modeling is a basic engineering skill – it can be used in almost any area of
application**

Can avoid expensive and time consuming experiments: a prediciton from a model
can be a guide for where to perform experiments.

Using computers
---------------

More data are put into computers for a bunch of reasons. One might ask, after a
lot of business data has ben digitized – can we use this data to draw
conclusions?

A model brings data to life. It is the important step between data and decison.

Computers can handle bigger, more complex models that humans!

> Models also help you build better software!

Course aims
===========

* Learning what realistic problems look like – by encountering them.
* Modelling skills
    * different model types
    * formulate your own modules
* Improving problem solving skills

Nobody in real life has any pure mathematical problems lying around. You must
formulate the proble in mathematical terms – only then will you find use for
the mathematics you already know.

Course structure
----------------

1. Monday introduction (to this week's problem module)
1. Do excercises and get supervision during the week.
1. Thursday the next week follows up those problems with a lecture.

Different problem modules focus on different model types.

*(Holidays may shift the schedule somewhat)*

How to work
===========

The path towards solving the problem is more important than coming up with the right one. **Failure is a learning opportunity**.

Do not search for solutions anywhere, even online. Do not pass on your solutions to other groups. **The goal is to think for yourselves and every group solving the problem on their own.** If you need to discuss a problem, do it with the teachers and TA:s.

The teachers have a certain style of guidance: They help incrementally. Ask several times about the same excercise. After you have worked for an hour of two, you can get more clues.

Don't worry about grades. 95 % pass the course.

### How to get higher grades

Talk with Dan, the examiner. Ask about your solutions. Ask where you are grade-wise to see how you can improve your grade. 

Dan appreciates these discussions. If you show that you want to learn, you can improve your grade **by doing extra work and learning some more**.
