I want this to be a checklist: Things to do before, during and after studying.
As algorithmically as possible. I want to make these habits.

* The routine:

** Sitting down
  - [ ] Put phone on quiet
  - [ ] Close all (unnecessary) tabs
  - [ ] If it's noisy, put on some techno on YouTube.
  - [ ] Do you have somewhere you need to go? Sometime you need to leave? Set a timer for that time.
  - [ ] Set pomodoro timer.
** Starting
  - [ ] Open learning plan in org-mode
  - [ ] Write down in learning plan: What is my motivation for learning this? (Get studying out
    of the way, because I need it for something else, deeply interesting, etc.)
  - [ ] Write down a goal in learning plan, small and achievable.
    - [ ] This can be a knowledge goal: summarize an article, set up an environment
    - [ ] It can also be a skill goal: write a program that does X, make a proof, do an exercise.
  - [ ] Open mind-map in notebook.
** Wrapping up
  - [ ] Check off goals you met.
  - [ ] Remove redundant goals, try to cut down to just a few per branch.
  - [ ] Look for any gaps you can fill in the mind map.
    
* In-between
** Figuring out a task
  - [ ] ???
  - [ ] Look over the material you have. Table of contents, headings, Wikipedia ...
    - [ ] Fill in some main ideas.
    - [ ] Mark things you might need to learn first.
    - [ ] Mark things you already learnt, but may want to review.
** Starting
** Getting to work
  - [ ] Go top-down from a main topic in the mind map.
  - [ ] In org-mode, list a few choices you can make for where to start.
** Working
  - [ ] When you see several ways to go next, make note in org-mode.
  - [ ] Mark a default option.
  - [ ] On timer:
    - [ ] What am I paying attention to? Should I?
    - [ ] How well do I understand? How *difficult* is this?
    - [ ] Do I have a strategy? Is it working?
  - [ ] Fill in mind-map: what problems can this solve?
    
* Groups of topics

** Do one thing at a time
** Set and adhere to goals
** Adapt to prior knowledge
** Build the graph
** Empower choice
** Dive Deep
** Make it real
** Learn together
